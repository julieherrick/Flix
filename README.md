Please list two areas of the assignment you'd like to **discuss further with your peers** during the next class (examples include better ways to implement something, how to extend your app in certain ways, etc):

1. I would like to discuss how they implemented search bars. I struggled to add one to mine.
2. How people completed viewing the large movie poster by tapping on the cell. I am interested to see what methods other pwople took.

## Notes

I was trying to add a search bar to my app but it is not something I ended up having the time to do. I enjoyed getting to explore using table and collection view and see how different operations effect each of them.
